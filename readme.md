## Full Walkthrough
First, it checks whether Adobe Illustrator.exe is open with administrator permission or not if not it will create a small VBScript that requests Adobe Illustrator.exe to run as administrator. after administrator permission is granted it will start downloading the infected host's file from Discord Server Using the API in the TEMP directory. After that, it will replace the host's file from C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc directory. This host file contains 1000 Top Websites with 0.0.0.0 DNS blocks set up. Lastly, it deletes the VBScript.
